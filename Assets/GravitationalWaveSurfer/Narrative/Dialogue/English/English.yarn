Welcome to the tutorial!
First, try moving around. 
<<wait_for_input_action Move>>  
<<wait 2>>

Nice! This is how you'll navigate space to collect particles.   
<<disable_input_action Move>>

Let's stop moving, and, practice moving our aim cursor. 
<<wait_for_input_action CursorPosition>>  
<<wait 2>>
<<enable_input_action Move>>

Simple, right? 
This is the end of the tutorial, exit whenever you'd like to!
